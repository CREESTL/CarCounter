**Summary**
This program was created by me during one semester at my university. The main idea was to create a program that could find, count and track 
vehicles on the video.
I know that you wish to try it out first and then to explore the code. So all you need to do is to change some paths in the code.
On line 3 put the path to the folder where you download my project. Then put this line to the command prompt (without "#") and execute. 
After that put the 4th line to the prompt and do execute. The result should appear at yout screen
_Have fun!_
